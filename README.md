# Malware-unpacking

A few (script based) malware samples to unpack, intendeded for blueteam training.
There are 10 samples in total that gets progressively more difficult.
Solutions provided in the teachers .ZIP file.

- **XtrExcercise_Student.zip** = Contains the student parts, no solutions are included just the initial file. 
- **XtrExcercise_teachers.zip** = Contains all files including extracted files for comparison.
  
Password fort the .ZIP files is *kebabsauce* without *sauce*

PLEASE NOTE that:
- The files included in the .ZIP files are recently collected malware samples (as of August 2019), some may still have a 0/n detection rate on Virustotal so be VERY careful when playing around with them. It is highly recommended to use an isolated VM to do the unpacking.
- All samples should be identifyable with Virustotal, so use a hash to query Virustotal for info of the specific malware.

This is only ment to be an introduction thing to malware unpacking and it has a best before date as attackers change their tactics all the time.

**Required tools**
- Virtualbox or VMWare player (both are free for personal use)
- A string reverser (StrReverse in VBS works).
- A HEX string 2 Binary converter.
- A Decimal array 2 Binary converter.
- Base 64 decoder (Certutil -decode <infile> <outfile> works fine).
- 7Zip.
- GZip.
- File identification type program.
- A binary XOR capable program.
- A text editor to do search/replace with.
- Hashing program (Sha1, Sha256, MD5. SSDeep is also useful).
  
*Certutil* can be used to produce file hashes:
- Certutil -hashfile FILENAME md5 | find /i /v "hash"
- Certutil -hashfile FILENAME sha1 | find /i /v "hash"
- Certutil -hashfile FILENAME sha256 | find /i /v "hash"
  
Some of the mentioned tools will be released here later on, others like GZIp, 7Zip, Virtualbox etc can be downloaded from their respective site if you're using Windows, some of them should be already available in Linux.
